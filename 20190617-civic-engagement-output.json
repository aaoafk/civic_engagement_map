In the spring semester of 2014, 15 student volunteers from Swarthmore College provided 450 hours of service at various locations in Chester, Holmes, Darby Borough, and Upper Darby in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. This year 3,006 tax returns were completed by program volunteers in total in Delaware County, returning $1,408,179 in Earned Income Tax Credit benefits to the local community. Twenty-six volunteers contributed over 655 hours of service, which helped recover $406,830 in Child Tax Credits and $115,269 in Education Tax Credits for local taxpayers.</span></p>\n",
