Civic Engagement Map

## Introduction

This project was proposed by **Denise Crossan**, who is a Lang Visiting Professor, of the Lang Center for Civic & Social Responsibility at Swarthmore College as part of the 2019 Swarthmore Projects for Educational Exploration & Development ([SPEED](https://www.swarthmore.edu/its/swarthmore-projects-educational-exploration-and-development-speed-program)) Program. The project is led by **Doug Willen** of Swarthmore College, as well as **Steven Ferenandez ('20)** and **Helen Huh ('21)**.

The Eugene M. Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility(https://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center/about-lang-center) facilitates Swarthmore College’s commitment to intellectual rigor, ethical engagement, and social responsibility by connecting what we call the three C’s: curriculum, campus, and communities. The Lang Center connects the College’s curricular excellence with engagement in all of those communities using an approach that we identify as “Engaged Scholarship.”

## Motivation

The Civic Engagement Map is a platform that allows the entire campus community to 
1) visualization,  through pins, of the variety of civic engagement activities on campus for Faculty, Staff, Students and Community Partners, 
2) an opportunity to see and support new partnerships, and 
3) a way to measure our civic engagement social impact.  

## Goals

We wanted to upgrade the current civic engagement map [site](http://mapmyorg.net/), which had limited functionatlity, using Mapbox's API for a more solid interface as well as streamline the process of adding pins to the map. Additionally, we wanted to expand the website's functions in order to make the user's experience on the site much more interactive.
