Scope of project

Visualize civil engagements that are occuring on the campus vis Mapbox.

Original project used Node + WordPress for data entry
This project was handed off to Les
Some functionality was added here, but not too much

What features do we want to make use of? (AR, points, etc.)

For AR stuff, we may have to use other tools such as Unity, AR Kit, etc.

MapBox studio may help us manage data.

The base map of the project can be completely customized.
